fTip - Languages
================




ADD A NEW LANGUAGE:
-------------------

to add a new language, do the following:



1. open your mysql-database "ftip" (e.g. via phpmyadmin)


2. go to table "languages" and insert your new language, where
    - "language" is your new language, written in nativ, e.g. "Francaise" or "Polski"
    - "suffix" is the language suffix, e.g. "fr" for french or "nl" for netherlands
    

3. go to filesystemfolder  ftip/languages/   and create a new folder, named with the suffix 
   of the language you entered in mysql, e.g. "fr" for french or "nl" for netherlands 
   

4. look which files exist in folder "en" (english), and copy them all into your new folder


5. replace the suffix of every copied file from ".en" to ".YOURSUFFIX" (e.g. ".fr" or ".nl")


6. open every file and translate them from english into your language


7. please commit your new language-folder to the fTip-project (maybe via CVS) on sourceforge
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/ftip
   
   

Have Fun !
